-- | Constants used with kCMTagCategory_PackingType to signal the nature of any packing applied in a buffer or channel.
--
-- A video packing can be one of several types including frame-packing for stereo views or texture atlasing. A CMTag having a CMTagCategory of kCMTagCategory_PackingType has a value that is an OSType indicating the kind of packing using a kCMPackingType_* constant.  Examples of frame-packing include side-by-side and over-under packing, There may be related CMTags if a kind of packing requires additional parameters. The requirements will be documented with the specific kind of packing.
--
-- kCMPackingType_None There is no packing. This is a traditional 2D texture. For this case no packing tag needs to be used.
--
-- kCMPackingType_SideBySide The packing uses a horizontal side-by-side packing of two views. By default, the left stereo eye view is to the left of the right stereo eye view. If the view order is reversed, indicated by kCMTagCategory_StereoViewInterpretation/kCMStereoViewInterpretation_StereoOrderReversed, then the right view is to the left of the left stereo view.
--
-- kCMPackingType_OverUnder The packing uses a vertical over-under (or top-and-bottom) packing of two views. By default, the left stereo eye view is above the right stereo eye view. If the view order is reversed, indicated by kCMTagCategory_StereoViewInterpretation/kCMStereoViewInterpretation_StereoOrderReversed, then the right view is above the left stereo view.

-- | Constants used with kCMTagCategory_ProjectionType to signal the nature of a video projection carried in a buffer or channel.
--
-- A video projection can be one of several types. Examples include 360 degree equirectangular, 180 degree half equirectangular, or a fisheye.  A CMTag having a CMTagCategory of kCMTagCategory_ProjectionType has a value that is an OSType indicating the kind of projection using a kCMProjectionType_* constant.  The kCMProjectionType_Rectangular projection type can signal that there is no projection other than the default 2D view. This is provided so it is possible to still signal a kCMTagCategory_ProjectionType CMTag but indicates it has no effect. 	The kCMProjectionType_ParametricImmersive projection type indicates a projection described mathematically by a model of camera lens calibration parameters. Parameters may be found in lens calibration metadata in kCMFormatDescriptionExtension_CameraCalibrationDataLensCollection with algorithm_kind parametric. If a kCMTagCategory_ProjectionType CMTag is not signaled, a rectangular projection is implied.  The kCMTagCategory_ProjectionType tag may be associated with other tags if projection related parameters are also signaled. What is carried will be defined for the specific type of projection.
--
-- kCMProjectionType_Rectangular There is no projection.This is a traditional 2D texture. Default if no projection type tag is signaled.
--
-- kCMProjectionType_Equirectangular The projection is a 360 degree equirectangular projection.
--
-- kCMProjectionType_HalfEquirectangular The projection is a 180 degree equirectangular projection.
--
-- kCMProjectionType_Fisheye This projection is used by Apple Immersive Video (AIV) video and requires AIME metadata to provide the projection details.  Only use this projection when working with AIV content.
--
-- kCMProjectionType_ParametricImmersive The projection is defined with a parametric description of lens distortion and image dewarping parameters.

-- | Flags used with kCMTagCategory_StereoView tags to signal the nature of the stereo views carried in a buffer or channel.
--
-- A "stereo eye" is either for the left eye or for the right eye. A CMTag signaling of stereo views can indicate the presence of one "stereo eye", both stereo eyes or no stereo eyes. A CMTag having a CMTagCategory of kCMTagCategory_StereoView has a value that is a set of kCMTagStereoViewComponent_* flags (see CMTagMakeWithFlagsValue()) that can be set to indicate the stereo eyes carried.  If neither the left nor the right stereo eye is signaled, this can be interpreted to mean that this is not stereo view related and is instead monoscopic video. If it is not stereo related, a kCMTagCategory_StereoView CMTag need not be associated with the buffer or channel.  kCMTagCategory_StereoView does not prescribe how the stereo views are carried. It might be contained in some kind of multiview carriage or might be frame packed in some way. The kCMTagCategory_PackingType will typically be available if frame packing of stereo views is used. The presence of a CMTag with kCMTagCategory_StereoView alone is insufficient to imply if there is some kind of packing or other mechanism required. Additional CMTags with other CMTagCategories may be necessary.  One or more kCMTagCategory_StereoView tags may be present in a collection. When considering which stereo eyes are represented by the collection, the same semantic can be expressed in more than one way in the collection. Specifying the same CMTag more than once has no meaning as the first occurrence indicates the stereo eye or stereo eyes are present.	Here are compatible semantics expressed by one or more CMTags:	- a single CMTag with kCMTagStereoViewsOption_LeftEye bitwise ORed with kCMTagStereoViewsOption_RightEye.	- two kCMTagCategory_StereoView CMTags with one CMTag having the value kCMTagStereoViewsOption_LeftEye and the other CMTag having the value kCMTagStereoViewsOption_RightEye.	- three or more CMTags made up of a CMTag with kCMTagStereoViewsOption_LeftEye bitwise ORed with kCMTagStereoViewsOption_RightEye and both a CMTag with only kCMTagStereoViewsOption_LeftEye and a CMTag with kCMTagStereoViewsOption_RightEye.	Likewise, if a collection contains only one or more CMTags with one stereo eye (e.g., kCMTagStereoViewsOption_LeftEye), only that stereo eye should be considered present.  The absence of a kCMTagCategory_StereoView CMTag is meant to indicate there is no stereo view present. If this signaling of no stereo eyes is associated with a buffer or channel that carries stereo eye views, the buffer or channel should be configured to present only a monoscopic view. This might be in the form of some fallback to a default view corresponding to a stereo eye or even to some other view it includes or can synthesize.
--
-- kCMTagStereoViewsOption_LeftEye the left stereo eye is present in encoded or decoded video buffers.
--
-- kCMTagStereoViewsOption_RightEye the right stereo eye is present in encoded or decoded video buffers.

-- | Flags used with kCMTagCategory_StereoViewInterpretation tags to signal additional information that may be important to the interpretation of stereo views carried in a buffer or channel.
--
-- A buffer or channel may carry one or more stereo eye views. The signaling of the presence of individual stereo eye views can be done using CMTags with a kCMTagCategory_StereoView category and correspondng kCMTagStereoViewComponent_* constants. There may however be additional signaling that is valuable beyond the presence of a stereo eye. The kCMTagCategory_StereoViewInterpretation category allows additional signaling that may be relevant for interpretation of storage, ordering or other details regarding the stereo views.  A CMTag having a CMTagCategory of kCMTagCategory_StereoViewInterpretation has a value that is a set of kCMStereoViewInterpretation_* flags (see CMTagMakeWithFlagsValue()) that can be set to indicate additional aspects of the stereo view or stereo views. The absence of a flag indicates the default interpretation of that feature or aspect should occur. If a flag is set, the semantic of that feature and only that feature should be inferred.  Two stereo view interpretations are currently defined.  One is that the order of stereo views is the reverse of the default of left then right. Here, order can be the geometric order such as in frame packed video or in something such as storage order.  The second is that buffers or channels contain views other than the left stereo eye view and the right stereo eye view. Such a view might be used as an alternative when perhaps monoscopic view is to be used instead of selecting the left or right stereo view or synthesizing something based upon the left and right stereo eye views.  The absence of a kCMTagCategory_StereoViewInterpretation CMTag is meant to indicate defaults are used.  Specifying kCMStereoViewInterpretation_Default is equivalent to the absence of a CMTag with category kCMTagCategory_StereoViewInterpretation.
--
-- kCMStereoViewInterpretation_Default no additional interpretation other than the default is implied by this tag. The absence of a tag of the kCMTagCategory_StereoViewInterpretation is considered equivalent to a CMTag having the kCMStereoViewInterpretation_Default value.
--
-- kCMStereoViewInterpretation_StereoOrderReversed the order of the stereo left eye and stereo right eye are reversed from the default of left being first and right being second in whatever geometric sense or storage sense that might imply. If set to 0, the order is the default left and then right eye.
--
-- kCMStereoViewInterpretation_AdditionalViews one or more additional views may be present beyond stereo left and stereo right eyes (e.g,. a “centerline” view). If set to 0, there are no additional views beyond the stereo views or no additional views can be determined to exist.

-- An enum indicating the available CMTagCategory identifiers that can be used to distinguish the tag from other kinds.
--

--
-- kCMTagCategory_Undefined Indicates there is no category specified for this value or it could not be determined. CMTags should typically not have this category except as sentinel values.
--
-- kCMTagCategory_MediaType Value is an OSType holding a CMMediaType.
--

--
-- kCMTagCategory_VideoLayerID Value is a signed 64-bit integer specifying the video layer identifier.
--

--
-- kCMTagCategory_PackingType Indicates this channel is packed in some way (e.g., frame packed, texture atlas). The value is an OSType carrying kCMPackingType_* constants.
--
-- kCMTagCategory_ProjectionType Indicates textures are related to a kind of texture projection (e.g., equirectangular). The value is an OSType carrying one of the kCMProjectionType_* constants.
--
-- kCMTagCategory_StereoView Indicates this channel is related to carrying stereographic views. The value is a Flags value carrying one of the kCMTagStereoViewComponent_* constants.
--
-- kCMTagCategory_StereoViewInterpretation Indicates this channel has non default stereo view interpretation (e.g., stereo eye view order is reversed.) Tags with this category will typically be associated with tags of category kCMTagCategory_StereoView. This tag alone however does not indicate which stereo eyes are present. The value is a Flags value carrying one of the kCMTagStereoInterpretationOption_* constants.
