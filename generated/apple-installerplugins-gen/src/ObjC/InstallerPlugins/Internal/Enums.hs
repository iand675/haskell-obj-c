-- Describes the direction in which a pane is entered or exited.
--
-- InstallerDirectionForward Specifies that the pane was entered/exited while moving in the forward direction.
--
-- InstallerDirectionBackward Specifies that the pane was entered/exited while moving backwards.
--
-- InstallerDirectionUndefined Specifies that the pane was entered/exited using the gotoPane: method.  Since the pane
--
-- is "jumped" to rather than moved to going forward or back, InstallerDirectionUndefined is used.
