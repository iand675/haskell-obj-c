-- | FFCONDITION
--
-- Contains type-specific information for the following effects.	SPRING	DAMPER	INERTIA	FRICTION
--
-- A pointer to an array of FFCONDITION structures for an effect is passed in the lpvTypeSpecificParams member of the FFEFFECT structure. The number of elements in the array must be either one, or equal to the number of axes associated with the effect.   Different types of conditions interpret the parameters differently, but the basic idea is that force resulting from a condition is equal to A(q - q0) where A is a scaling coefficient, q is some metric, and q0 is the neutral value for that metric.   The preceding simplified formula must be adjusted if a nonzero deadband is provided. If the metric is less than lOffset - lDeadBand, the resulting force is given by the following formula: force = lNegativeCoefficient * (q - (lOffset - lDeadBand))   Similarly, if the metric is greater than lOffset + lDeadBand, the resulting force is given by the following formula:   force = lPositiveCoefficient * (q - (lOffset + lDeadBand))   A spring condition uses axis position as the metric.   A damper condition uses axis velocity as the metric.   An inertia condition uses axis acceleration as the metric.   If the number of FFCONDITION structures in the array is equal to the number of axes for the effect, the first structure applies to the first axis, the second applies to the second axis, and so on. For example, a two-axis spring condition with lOffset set to 0 in both FFCONDITION structures would have the same effect as the joystick self-centering spring. When a condition is defined for each axis in this way, the effect must not be rotated.   If there is a single FFCONDITION structure for an effect with more than one axis, the direction along which the parameters of the FFCONDITION structure are in effect is determined by the direction parameters passed in the rglDirection field of the FFEFFECT structure. For example, a friction condition rotated 45 degrees (in polar coordinates) would resist joystick motion in the northeast-southwest direction but would have no effect on joystick motion in the northwest-southeast direction.  lOffset Offset for the condition, in the range from -10,000 through 10,000.  lPositiveCoefficient Coefficient constant on the positive side of the offset, in the range from -10,000 through 10,000.  lNegativeCoefficient Coefficient constant on the negative side of the offset, in the range from -10,000 through 10,000.   If the device does not support separate positive and negative coefficients, the value of lNegativeCoefficient is ignored, and the value of lPositiveCoefficient is used as both the positive and negative coefficients.   dwPositiveSaturation Maximum force output on the positive side of the offset, in the range from 0 through 10,000.   If the device does not support force saturations, the value of this member is ignored.  dwNegativeSaturation Maximum force output on the negative side of the offset, in the range from 0 through 10,000.   If the device does not support force saturation, the value of this member is ignored.   If the device does not support separate positive and negative saturation, the value of dwNegativeSaturation is ignored, and the value of dwPositiveSaturation is used as both the positive and negative saturation.  lDeadBand Region around lOffset in which the condition is not active, in the range from 0 through 10,000. In other words, the condition is not active between lOffset minus lDeadBand and lOffset plus lDeadBand.

-- | FFEFFECT
--
-- UsUsed by the FFDeviceCreateEffect method to initialize a new effect object. It is also used by the FFEffectSetParameters and FFEffectGetParameters functions.
--
-- OBJECT IDS cannot be used to identify trigger buttons in dwTriggerButton, and output axes in rgdwAxes[n]. Please use object offsets (FFJOFS_* constants), the only supported method.  dwSize Size, in bytes, of this structure. This member must be initialized before the structure is used.   dwFlags Flags associated with the effect. This value can be a combination of one or more of the following values:	FFEFF_CARTESIAN The values of rglDirection are to be interpreted as Cartesian coordinates. 	FFEFF_OBJECTOFFSETS The values of dwTriggerButton and rgdwAxes are data format offsets, FFJOFS_* constants.  This flag is not necessary, as the format is assumed.  The OBJECTIDS method of specifying dwTriggerButton and rgdwAxes is not supported -- FFJOFS_* constants MUST be used.	FFEFF_POLAR The values of rglDirection are to be interpreted as polar coordinates. 	FFEFF_SPHERICAL The values of rglDirection are to be interpreted as spherical coordinates.   dwDuration The total duration of the effect, in microseconds. If this value is FF_INFINITE, the effect has infinite duration. If an envelope has been applied to the effect, the attack is applied, followed by an infinite sustain.    dwSamplePeriod The period at which the device should play back the effect, in microseconds. A value of 0 indicates that the default playback sample rate should be used. If the device is not capable of playing back the effect at the specified rate, it chooses the supported rate that is closest to the requested value. Setting a custom dwSamplePeriod can be used for special effects. For example, playing a sine wave at an artificially large sample period results in a rougher texture.   dwGain The gain to be applied to the effect, in the range from 0 through 10,000. The gain is a scaling factor applied to all magnitudes of the effect and its envelope.   dwTriggerButton The identifier or offset of the button to be used to trigger playback of the effect. The FFJOFS_* flags must be used to specify the value. If this member is set to FFEB_NOTRIGGER, no trigger button is associated with the effect.   dwTriggerRepeatInterval The interval, in microseconds, between the end of one playback and the start of the next when the effect is triggered by a button press and the button is held down. Setting this value to FF_INFINITE suppresses repetition.   cAxes Number of axes involved in the effect. This member must be filled in by the caller if changing or setting the axis list or the direction list. The number of axes for an effect cannot be changed once it has been set.   rgdwAxes Pointer to a DWORD array (of cAxes elements) containing identifiers or offsets identifying the axes to which the effect is to be applied. The FFJOFS_* flags must be used to specify the values in the array. The list of axes associated with an effect cannot be changed once it has been set. No more than 32 axes can be associated with a single effect.   rglDirection Pointer to a LONG array (of cAxes elements) containing either Cartesian coordinates, polar coordinates, or spherical coordinates. The flags FFEFF_CARTESIAN, FFEFF_POLAR, and FFEFF_SPHERICAL determine the semantics of the values in the array. If Cartesian, each value in rglDirection is associated with the corresponding axis in rgdwAxes. If polar, the angle is measured in hundredths of degrees from the (0, -1) direction, rotated in the direction of (1, 0). This usually means that north is away from the user, and east is to the user's right. The last element is not used. If spherical, the first angle is measured in hundredths of a degree from the (1, 0) direction, rotated in the direction of (0, 1). The second angle (if the number of axes is three or more) is measured in hundredths of a degree toward (0, 0, 1). The third angle (if the number of axes is four or more) is measured in hundredths of a degree toward (0, 0, 0, 1), and so on. The last element is not used. Note:  The rglDirection array must contain cAxes entries, even if polar or spherical coordinates are given. In these cases, the last element in the rglDirection array is reserved for future use and must be 0.   lpEnvelope Optional pointer to a FFENVELOPE structure that describes the envelope to be used by this effect. Not all effect types use envelopes. If no envelope is to be applied, the member should be set to NULL.   cbTypeSpecificParams Number of bytes of additional type-specific parameters for the corresponding effect type.   lpvTypeSpecificParams TPointer to type-specific parameters, or NULL if there are no type-specific parameters. If the effect is of type FFEFT_CONDITION, this member contains a pointer to an array of FFCONDITION structures that define the parameters for the condition. A single structure may be used, in which case the condition is applied in the direction specified in the rglDirection array. Otherwise, there must be one structure for each axis, in the same order as the axes in rgdwAxes array. If a structure is supplied for each axis, the effect should not be rotated; you should use the following values in the rglDirection array: 	FFEFF_SPHERICAL: 0, 0, ... 	FFEFF_POLAR: 9000, 0, ... 	FFEFF_CARTESIAN: 1, 0, ... If the effect is of type FFEFT_CUSTOMFORCE, this member contains a pointer to a FFCUSTOMFORCE structure that defines the parameters for the custom force. If the effect is of type FFEFT_PERIODIC, this member contains a pointer to a FFPERIODIC structure that defines the parameters for the effect. If the effect is of type FFEFT_CONSTANTFORCE, this member contains a pointer to a FFCONSTANTFORCE structure that defines the parameters for the constant force. If the effect is of type FFEFT_RAMPFORCE, this member contains a pointer to a FFRAMPFORCE structure that defines the parameters for the ramp force.   dwStartDelay Time (in microseconds) that the device should wait after a FFEffectStart call before playing the effect. If this value is 0, effect playback begins immediately.
