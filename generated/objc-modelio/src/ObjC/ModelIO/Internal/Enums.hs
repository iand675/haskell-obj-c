-- | MDLCamera
--
-- MDLCamera models a physically plausible camera.
--
-- Values are represented as float in MDLCamera as it offers sufficient  precision, and because calculations will be identical on any processor architecture. This consistency is a requirement of the model.
--
-- MDLCamera provides the a model of the parameters governing the physical process  of transforming a scene into an image.
--
-- This process is modeled as a series of steps, each governed by the physical properties of real world cameras.
--
-- 1. The position and orientation of the camera
--
-- See: MDLObject transform property
--
-- The MDLTransformComponent on an MDLCamera is an MDLTransform.
--
-- 2. Visible Objects and Lights
--
-- nearVisibilityDistance The minimum distance from the camera of a
--
-- visible object
--
-- farVisibilityDistance The maximum distance from the camera of a
--
-- visible object
--
-- Those objects existing between nearVisibilityDistance and farVisibilityDistance     are considered to be visible. All lights are considered, irrespective of     nearVisibilityDistance and farVisibilityDistance, to compute scene luminance.
--
-- worldToMetersConversionScale
--
-- Some calculations, such as the calculation of stereo view matrices, require    calculations to occur in world space. Significant quantities measured in mm    therefore use this conversion scale to perform the calculation. The default    value is 1.0.
--
-- 3. Scene Luminance through the lens
--
-- barrelDistorion
--
-- fisheyeDistortion
--
-- Illuminated objects result in scene luminance, which passes through the lens.    All lenses impose some amount of radial distortion which can be computed from     focal length. However, some lenses introduce error, and radial distortion can     be used as an aesthetic control as well. Therefore radial distortion is     provided as a property. If r is the radial distance of a pixel from the center     of the projection, then radial distortion is computed as
--
-- r' = r * (1 + barrelDistorion * r^2 + fisheyeDistortion * r^4)
--
-- radialDistortion sufficiently describes the distortion characteristic of most     lenses. In order to simulate certain other lenses, such as those found in     security cameras, fisheye lenses, plastic toy lenses, sport cameras, or some     VR headsets, radialDistortion2 is introduced.
--
-- The default for the radial distortion parameters is zero, resulting in a     rectilinear projection.
--
-- opticalVignetting
--
-- Optical vignetting occurs to some degree in all lenses. It results from light     at the edge of an image being blocked as it travels past the lens hood and     the internal lens apertures. It is more prevalent with wide apertures. A     value of zero indicates no optical vignetting is occuring, and a value of one     indicates that vignetting affects all locations in the image according to     radial distance. Optical vignetting also occurs in head mounted displays, and     the value here can be used as an intended amount of vignetting to apply to an    image.
--
-- chromaticAberration
--
-- Chromatic aberration occurs to some degree in all lenses. It results from a     lens bringing different wavelengths of light to focus at different places on     the image plane. A value of zero indicates no chromatic aberration is     occurring, and one indicates maximum. Chromatic aberration affects all     locations in the image according to radial distance. Chromatic aberration     also occurs in head mounted displays, and the value here can be used as an     intended amount of chromatic aberration to apply to an image.
--
-- 4. Geometry of the lens
--
-- This is a thin lens model.
--
-- focalLength
--
-- The default focal length is 50mm, corresponding to a field of view of 54     degrees, and vertical sensor aperture of 24mm. Changing focalLength will     update the field of view property.
--
-- focusDistance
--
-- The distance, in meters, at which the lens is focused. The default is 2.5m.
--
-- fieldOfView
--
-- The field of view is calculated from the focal length and sensor aperture.    Changing the field of view will update the focalLength property with respect     to the sensor aperture. The default is 54 degrees, corresponding to a focal     length of 50mm, and a vertical sensor aperture of 24mm.
--
-- fStop
--
-- The f-stop is the ratio of the lens' focal length to the diameter of the     entrance pupil. The default is 5.6. It controls the amount of light that     reaches the sensor, as well as the size of out of focus parts of the image.    The diameter of the entrance pupil, is therefore obtained    by dividing the fStop by the focalLength.
--
-- 5. Lens exit aperture
--
-- apertureBladeCount
--
-- The shape of out of focus highlights in a scene is commonly known as "bokeh".     The aesthetic quality of a lens' bokeh is one of the characteristics that     drives the choice of a lens for a particular scene. To a large degree, the     appearance of bokeh is governed by the shape of the lens aperture. Typical     lens apertures are controlled by a series of overlapping blades that can be     irised open and closed. A lens with a five blade aperture will yield a five    sided bokeh. The default is zero, which is to be interpreted as a perfectly     round aperture.
--
-- Note that the effect of a filter on the front of the lens can be modeled     equivalently at the exit aperture. The MIOCamera does not explicitly provide     specification of such effects, but a simulation could incorporate them at     this stage.
--
-- maximumCircleOfConfusion
--
-- Although the size of an out of focus bokeh highlight can be computed from    other camera properties, it is often necessary to limit the size of the     circle of confusion for aesthetic reasons. The circle of confusion is     specified in mm, and the default is 0.05mm. The units are mm on the sensor     plane.
--
-- shutterOpenInterval
--
-- The length of time in seconds the shutter is open, impacting the amount of     light that reaches the sensor and also the length of motion blur trails. The     shutter time is not the same thing as scene frame rate. The rule of thumb for     movies is that the shutter time should be half the frame rate, so to achieve    a "filmic" look, the shutter time choice might be 1/48 of a second, since     films are usually projected at 24 frames per second. Shutter time is     independent of simulation frame rate because motion blur trails and exposure     times should be held constant in order to avoid flicker artifacts.
--
-- 6. Sensor illuminance
--
-- sensorVerticalAperture
--
-- The default aperture is 24mm, corresponding to a 35mm stills camera.    _____________________    [][][][][][][][][][][              ^     \\     |         |  \\      ^       |      \\    |         |   \\    24mm   35mm       \\   |         |    \\    v       |       ][][][][][][][][][][]           v       ---------------------           <- 36mm -->
--
-- Changing the aperture will update the field of view property with respect to     the focal length. The horizontal aperture can be calculated from the aspect     property.
--
-- sensorAspect
--
-- aspect ratio of width versus height of the sensor aperture. The default is     36mm/24mm, ie: 1.5.
--
-- sensorEnlargement
--
-- The sensor enlargment property scales the active region of the sensor. A     zoom factor of 2 will result in the central portion of the image being     cropped and expanded to fill the image plane. The default is 1.
--
-- sensorShift
--
-- The sensor shift property moves the center of the sensor relative to the     lens. This is useful in certain calculations, such as shadow or reflection    projections, as well as to provide vergence in a parallel stereoscopic camera.
--
-- 7. Exposure
--
-- Finally, the sensor values need to be converted for display.
--
-- flash
--
-- Flashing is applied to a film stock some time before processing. It is a     small and even level of exposure added to the entire image intended shift     the brightness and color of darker areas of the image. Since exposure is     logarithmic, flash does not affect midtones or highlights.
--
-- The equivalent to flash in a color grading system is known as lift. Typically     red, green, and blue can be controlled independently.
--
-- A negative value for flash can be used to subtract color.
--
-- exposure
--
-- Finally, exposure should be applied to the compressed value. Red,    green, and blue exposure can be specified separately. The default is 1.0.
--
-- exposureCompression
--
-- Gamma curve compression where values below the x value are to be passed through,    about the y value, values are to be clamped at maximum display brightness,    and a function such as a logarithmic ramp is to be applied in between. The    default is (1,0, 1.0).
--
-- A displayable value is therefore obtained via       pow(exposureCompression((sensor value + flash) * exposure), displayGamma)

-- | MDLMaterialSemantic
--
-- The material semantics are identifiers for material properties             formally identified by one of the standard material descriptors.
--
-- When files containing material properties are loaded and translated              by ModelIO, an appropriate standard material descriptor will be              chosen, and any properties translated from the loaded file can be              retrieved using one of these semantics.
